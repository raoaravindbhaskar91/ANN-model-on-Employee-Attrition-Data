Steps involved: 

a) Data Import (Target variable is "Attrition" column)
b) Split the data in Dev & Hold Out sample (70:30)
c) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
d) Identify columns which are of no use. drop those columns
e) Write Hypothesis and validate the Hypothesis
f) Build Neural Network Model (Development sample)
g) Validate NN model on Hold Out. If need be,  improvise
